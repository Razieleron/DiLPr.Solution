#### _A Mvc app for Dogs to find other dogs and see if they're inpupatible or down to woof. Made for Team Week at Epicodus Coding School._

## Technologies Used 

* _C#_
* _.NET_
* _HTML_
* _MVC_
* _SQL Workbench_
* _Entity Framework_
* _CSS_

## Description

A community based Mvc web app that brings folks (or in this case pupprs) together.

A puppr can:

* Register for an account and login.

* Update their profile picture, update their age and breed, and list interests(for example: cheese, running, peaceful naps).

* View the profiles of other pupprs and swipe "yes" or "no" on them based on their profile information.

* Search for other pupprs by viewing a list of hosted interests.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

*  _Clone this repo._
*  _Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "DiLPr"._
*  _In the command line, run the command ``dotnet run`` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal._
*  _Optionally, you can run ``dotnet build`` to compile this console app without running it._
*  _This program was built using `Microsoft .NET SDK 6.0`, and may not be compatible with other versions._

*  _If you want to run the project in production mode with a watcher, you can use a command line flag to specify that you want to run the "production" profile. ``dotnet watch run --launch-profile "production"``_
*  _Open the browser to [https://localhost:5001]. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate.](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate)_

## SQL Workbench Configuration
* ðŸ”§ _Create an `appsetting.json` file in the "Factory" directory of the project._
* ðŸ”§ _Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL._ 
```json
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=dilpr_weds;uid=[YOUR-USERNAME-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
    }
}
```
* ðŸ”§ _If you'd like to push this cloned project to a public-facing repository, remember to add the appsettings.json file to your .gitignore first._
* ðŸ”§ _Once "appsettings.json" file has been created, follow the below directions for Entity Framework Migration Configuration._ 

## Entity Framework Migration Configuration

* _In root directory of project folder "DiLPr", run `dotnet ef migrations add restoreDatabase`_
* _Then run $ `dotnet ef database update`_
* _Open SQL Workbench._
* _Navigate to "" schema._
* _Click the drop down, select "Tables" drop down._
* _Verify the tables. There should be: ._

## Stretch Goals

* _Add location services so you can know which puppr is closest to you._

* _Associate "liked" and "disliked" profiles with active user's profile._

## Known Bugs

* _Login/Register returns an unhandled error if there are misspellings or input mistakes._
